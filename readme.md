# Tic Tac Toe 3x3

## Project Overview

**MediaGame** is an online gaming start-up aiming to enhance user experiences by offering new and exciting games. This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe game with an expanded 20x20 board, allowing two players to compete in a larger grid. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores data in local storage.

## Features

- **Game Board**: A 20x20 grid where players can place their symbols.
- **Player Turns**: Player 1 (X) starts, and players alternate turns.
- **Winning Condition**: A player wins by aligning 5 of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Game Status**: Detects and announces the winner or a draw when the board is full.
- **Restart Button**: Allows players to start a new game without refreshing the page.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the number of wins for each player.
- **Symbol Choice (Optional)**: Allows players to select their symbol before starting the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on both mobile devices and desktop computers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the game.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, DOM manipulation, and local storage.
